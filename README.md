# Directive Error Categories
A way to categorizing errors, using the "directive" abstraction

This repository contains the article I wrote that attempts to outline a way of categorizing errors, using the abstraction of a real world directive. The article is provided in this repository in [Article.md](./Article.md). It is posted to GitHub to ensure it remains public and easily accessible to anyone interested.
